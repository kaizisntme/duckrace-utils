# Duck Race Utils

In this repo, there will be some code snippets used to change how the [Duck Race](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/duck-race/) works, including changing, choosing winner/loser... For these codes, you need the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension, which allows us to modify to source of the website (it's quite similar to the way we use `Console` tab in DevTools, but with this extension, you can do it automatically). In addition, there's also a tutorial of "The way I found this method of modifying", if you need.

# Snippets usage

- **Requirement**: Tampermonkey (or alternative extension)
- Click the installation link which is provided in the below table
- Click "Install this script" button
- Wait until the script is redirected to Tampermonkey dashboard, click "Install" and enjoy :)!
- In some snippets, you need to config the data, read the comment section (under script info section) carefully
